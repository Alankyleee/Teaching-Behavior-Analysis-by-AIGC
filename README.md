# Research on Intelligent Collection and Application of Classroom Teaching Behaviors Supported by AIGC



This project is using AIGC to assist to code the classroom teaching behaviors.

Teaching behavior analysis has significant implications for teaching diagnosis and quality, and can also serve as a basis for assisting teachers in reflection and evidence-based teaching. However, previous automated research methods mostly used deep learning models trained on specific samples, resulting in automated analysis of coding categories that were rather shallow and singular. These methods could not adapt to different coding systems required for complex teaching scenarios, nor could they modify coding or perform multi-coding analysis based on scenario needs. This study constructs a practical framework for classroom teaching behavior analysis supported by AIGC (AI-Generated Content). Based on this framework, automatic coding and analysis of classroom data from both online and offline scenarios were conducted. By comparing the results of automatic classification by AIGC with other AI models, the advantages and disadvantages of using AIGC for automatic data collection were analyzed. To address the hallucination output issue of large language models, an application path of "multi-machine collaboration with human-in-the-loop" for risk avoidance was proposed, aiming to improve the personalization and intelligence level of classroom behavior collection technology.

# AIGC 支持下的课堂教学行为智能采集与应用研究

教学行为分析对于教学诊断和质量有较大意义，亦能够做为辅助教师反思和循证教学的依据。但以往的自动化研究方法多采用深度学习模型针对特定样本进行训练，能够自动化分析的编码类别较为粗浅和单一，无法适用于复杂教学场景所需的不同编码体系，也无法根据场景需要改动编码或者进行多编码分析。本研究构建了 AIGC 支持的课堂教学行为分析实践框架，基于框架对线上线下两种场景的课堂数据进行自动编码和分析，对比 AIGC 与其他 AI 模型自动分类的结果分析了 AIGC 用于自动采集的优缺点，针对大模型存在输出幻觉的缺陷提出了“多机协同，人在回路”的风险规避应用路径，以期提高课堂行为采集技术的个性化与智能化水平。
